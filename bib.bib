abstract="We develop a reference implementation for a fragment of the API for a Trusted Platform Module. Our code is written in a functional language, suitable for verification with various tools, but is automatically translated to a subset of C, suitable for interoperability testing with production code, and for inclusion in a specification or standard for the API. One version of our code corresponds to the widely deployed TPM 1.2 specification, and is vulnerable to a recently discovered dictionary attack; verification of secrecy properties of this version fails producing an attack trace and highlights an ambiguity in the specification that has security implications. Another version of our code corresponds to a suggested amendment to the TPM 1.2 specification; verification of this version succeeds. From this case study we conclude that recent advances in tools for verifying implementation code for cryptographic APIs are reaching the point where it is viable to develop verified reference implementations. Moreover, the published code can be in a widely understood language like C, rather than one of the specialist formalisms aimed at modelling cryptographic protocols.",

abstract="Trusted computing relies on formally verified trusted computing platforms to achieve high security assurance. In practice, however, new platforms are often proposed without a comprehensive formal evaluation and explicitly defined underlying assumptions. In this work, we propose TRUSTFOUND, a formal foundation and framework for model checking trusted computing platforms. TRUSTFOUND includes a logic for formally modeling platforms, a model of trusted computing techniques and a broad spectrum of threat models. It can be used to check platforms on security properties (e.g., confidentiality and attestability) and uncover the implicit assumptions that must be satisfied to guarantee the security properties. In our experiments, TRUSTFOUND is used to encode and model check two trusted platforms. It has identified a total of six implicit assumptions and two severe previously-unknown logic flaws from them.",

abstract="Secure outsourcing of computation to an untrusted (cloud) service provider is becoming more and more important. Pure cryptographic solutions based on fully homomorphic and verifiable encryption, recently proposed, are promising but suffer from very high latency. Other proposals perform the whole computation on tamper-proof hardware and usually suffer from the the same problem. Trusted computing (TC) is another promising approach that uses trusted software and hardware components on computing platforms to provide useful mechanisms such as attestation allowing the data owner to verify the integrity of the cloud and its computation. However, on the one hand these solutions require trust in hardware (CPU, trusted computing modules) that are under the physical control of the cloud provider, and on the other hand they still have to face the challenge of run-time attestation.",

pages="150--166",
abstract="Systems designed with measurement and attestation in mind are often layered, with the lower layers measuring the layers above them. Attestations of such systems must report the results of a diverse set of application-specific measurements of various parts of the system. There is a pervasive intuition that measuring the system ``bottom-up'' (i.e. measuring lower layers before the layers above them) is more robust than other orders of measurement. This is the core idea behind trusted boot processes. In this paper we justify this intuition by characterizing the adversary actions required to escape detection by bottom-up measurement. In support of that goal, we introduce a formal framework with a natural and intuitive graphical representation for reasoning about layered measurement systems.",
